To design a syllabus for a vanilla JavaScript course from beginner to advanced, with an emphasis on operators, controls, and other key concepts, you can structure the course into the following modules:

2. **JavaScript Basics**
   - Variables, Constants, and Data Types
   - Operators (Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical)
   - Control Structures (if, else, switch)
   - Loops (for, while, do-while)
   - Functions and Scope

3. **Working with Objects and Classes**
   - Introduction to Objects
   - Object Methods and Properties
   - Classes and Constructor Functions
   - Inheritance and Prototypes
   - Understanding "this" Keyword
   - Classes & Prototypes
   - Methods in Classes & In Constructors

4. **Advanced JavaScript Concepts**
   - Closures and Memory Management
   - Factory Functions
   - Recursion and Advanced Recursion
   - Pure Functions & Side-Effects
   - Impure vs Pure Functions
   - Optional: Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)

5. **Working with the DOM**
   - DOM Access and Manipulation

   - The "location" and "history" Objects
   - The "navigator" Object
   - Browser Support and Feature Detection

10. **Advanced Topics**
    - Web Components
    - Performance Optimization
    - JavaScript Testing and Debugging
    - Modern JavaScript and ES6+ Features

Throughout the course, students should be encouraged to write code, solve problems, and build projects to apply what they've learned. The syllabus should also include resources for further learning and debugging techniques. Each module can be further broken down into specific lessons and topics, with each lesson focusing on a specific aspect of JavaScript.  

For a more detailed curriculum, you can refer to the course curriculum provided by Academind Pro [3], which includes a comprehensive breakdown of topics and concepts to be covered in each module. This can serve as a guide to create a more structured and in-depth syllabus for your JavaScript course.
